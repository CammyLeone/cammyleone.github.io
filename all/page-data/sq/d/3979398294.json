{"data":{"contentfulAbout":{"aboutMe":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"rawMarkdownBody":"## What is this project?\n\nWelcome!  This repository is a collection of projects for prodommes, perverts, and programmers of prostate pleasure.  Each website or library here has a common thread:\nit can make your bluetooth-connected sex toys vibrate with *no app, less headache, and better security*.\n\nIt was born during a time where \"socially-distant sex\" was something people actually *said* - and hopefully the toys inside will be fun enough to endure even when we *can* safely touch each others' parts again.\n\n## Who built these?\n\nEverything you see was lovingly crafted by me, Cammy Leone.  \n\nI'm a lot of things - I chameleon as a slutty performance artist (book me for your party!), porn performer and producer (book me for your porn!), and apparently I also write code for vibrating your sex toys.\n\nYou can buy my media and follow me on social media at [cammyleone.com](cammyleone.com).\n\n## What's inside?\n\n### Say *(it Again)*\n\nRepetition is the key to learning to be the best submissive you can be.  Whether for punishment, or for worship, or for pure entertainment, you can give your submissive a writing assignment with *Say (it Again)*.  \n\nMake them type any phrase - like \"I am a brainless slave to &lt;YOUR NAME HERE>\" - a hundred times, without typos, to prove their devotion.\n\nEach line they type creates stronger vibrations (and makes the next line more of a challenge).  Drive your point home with *Say (it Again)*:\n\n* [Demo](https://plug.willyouplease.me/say/)\n* [Create a new writing assignment](https://plug.willyouplease.me/say/#/new)\n\n---\n\n### Vibe\n\nLet's review the status quo of getting a partner to control your toy.  The conversation goes like this:\n> \"Okay, you need to find the Lovense app on the App Store install it.  Installed?  Cool.  Now create an account.  No, you don't have to use a real email address.  Cool, what's your username?  Okay, I sent you a friend request; you've gotta accept it.  Awesome, you're my friend now.  I just sent you a remote pairing request; did you get it?  Good.  Now you can click the \"Live Control\" button and slide my sliders around.\"\n\nMost people get bored or confused about 2 steps into process and never bother using these toys with partners.   That's why *Vibe* was built.  With  Vibe, it looks like this:\n> \"Go to [Vibe](https://plug.willyouplease.me/vibe/#/).  See my name and the slider underneath?  Drag the slider around, and it - ohhhh yep, whnn yuu mmmm ðŸ¤¤ mhmmm ðŸ’¦\n\nAlso!  [Vibe](https://plug.willyouplease.me/vibe/#/) works with groups of people.  Control up to 20 friends' toys in real time.\n\n---\n\n### Rinse\n\nSome findommes like to drain wallets using [RT games](https://twitter.com/search?q=RT%20Game%20hour&src=typed_query) in which every like / retweet / comment adds to the amount of debt the submissive owes after a certain amount of time.\n\nThis is a site that lets you and your submissive watch the amount go up in real-time.  As a bonus, you can attach a toy and get extra excitement - the more money owed, the stronger the vibrations.\n\nClick [this link](https://plug.willyouplease.me/rinse/#/new) to start a new Rinse.\n\n---\n\n### Tribute\n\nGot a website with a button that begs to be clicked? Need to give your website customers some encouragement to click an important link?\n\nThis script, when embedded on your website, imbues an HTML element with the magical power of making your user's bluetooth-enabled sex toy vibrate. As their cursor gets closer to the button, it vibrates more strongly!\n\n[Install it now](https://github.com/CammyLeone/devious-buttplug/tree/main/tribute-lib#buttplug-tribute), if you want to.\n\n---\n\n### react-buttplug\n\nAll of the above apps are powered by [react-buttplug](https://github.com/CammyLeone/devious-buttplug/tree/main/react-buttplug).  It's not published to NPM yet, but it will be soon.  Give me a poke if you want me to hurry up on that.\n"}},"profile":{"title":"Mate Logo","image":{"src":"//images.ctfassets.net/7gwzcwdqbf0r/6nf3rNaaVaUqYcoAcciSeC/fc164626ec4bb12e5a3c24bc97589927/Mate_Logo.png?w=450&fl=progressive&q=100"}}}}}
