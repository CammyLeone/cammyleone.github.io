{"data":{"contentfulAbout":{"aboutMe":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"rawMarkdownBody":"## What is this project?\n\nWelcome!  This repository is a collection of projects for prodommes, perverts, and programmers of prostate pleasure.  Each website or library here has a common thread:\nit can make your bluetooth-connected sex toys vibrate with *no app, less headache, and better security*.\n\nIt was born during a time where \"socially-distant sex\" was something people actually *said* - and hopefully the toys inside will be fun enough to endure even when we *can* safely touch each others' parts again.\n\n## Who built these?\n\nEverything you see was lovingly crafted by me, Cammy Leone.  \n\nI'm a lot of things - I chameleon as a slutty performance artist (book me for your party!), porn performer and producer (book me for your porn!), and apparently I also write code for vibrating your sex toys.\n\nYou can buy my media and follow me on social media at [cammyleone.com](cammyleone.com)."}},"profile":{"title":"Mate Logo","image":{"src":"//images.ctfassets.net/7gwzcwdqbf0r/6nf3rNaaVaUqYcoAcciSeC/fc164626ec4bb12e5a3c24bc97589927/Mate_Logo.png?w=450&fl=progressive&q=100"}}}}}
