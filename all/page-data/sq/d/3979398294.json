{"data":{"contentfulAbout":{"aboutMe":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"rawMarkdownBody":"## What is Distant Delights?\n\nWelcome!  This is a collection of projects for prodommes, perverts, and programmers of prostate pleasure.  Each website or library here has a common thread:\nit can make your bluetooth-connected sex toys vibrate with *no app, less headache, and better security*.\n\nIt was born during a time where \"socially-distant sex\" was a phrase people actually *said* - and hopefully the toys inside will be fun enough to endure even when we *can* safely touch each others' parts again.\n\n## Is this for me?\n\nIf you just want to control a partner's remote-controlled toy, give [Vibe](#Vibe) a spin.\n\nIf you're into kinky power dynamics, check out [Say It Again](#say-it-again).\n\nIf you collect money from your adoring fans, you'll like [Tribute](#tribute) and [Rinse](#rinse).\n\n## How does this work?\n\nThese sites use the browser (currently, only Chrome) to connect with your toy, not an app on your phone.  Your phone's Chrome browser should work, but these experiences are optimized for desktop use.\n\nAny of the toys from [this list](https://iostindex.com/?filter0Features=OutputsVibrators&filter1ButtplugSupport=2) should work.\n\n## Is this secure?\n\nNone of your personal information is collected, and none of it is sent to a server, anywhere.\n\nVibe uses whatever name you give it, and uses a server to communicate toy connectivity and intensity with other users.\n\nRinse uses a server to stream updates from Twitter, but no information about the user is communicated.\n\n## Who built these?\n\nEverything you see was lovingly crafted by me, [Cammy Leone](http://cammyleone.com).  \n\nI'm a lot of things - I chameleon as a slutty performance artist (book me for your party!), porn performer and producer (book me for your porn!), and apparently I also write code for vibrating your sex toys.\n\nYou can buy my media and follow me on social media at [cammyleone.com](cammyleone.com)."}},"profile":{"title":"Mate Logo","image":{"src":"//images.ctfassets.net/7gwzcwdqbf0r/6nf3rNaaVaUqYcoAcciSeC/fc164626ec4bb12e5a3c24bc97589927/Mate_Logo.png?w=450&fl=progressive&q=100"}}}}}
